This is an implementation of milliForth (sectorforth) concept for RISCV ISA.

Milliforth uses a minimal set of primitives and functions for make a Forth.

This version uses DJB2 hashes in headers, instead of size+flags+name+pads. 

No human WORDS. the IMMEDIATE flag is the lowbit (0) of hash.

Options:

    compiler suit of RISCV: gcc riscv64-unknown-elf-* -Oz

    which memory map be used and pages size: default GCC
  
    simulator of RISCV: qemu or spike ?
    
    the heap and stack in memory: .heap at end of .bss, .stack elsewhere ?

    systems calls of core functions: linux ecalls
    
## ISA

the RISCV is a 4 bytes (32-bit) cell CPU with 32-bit 
[ISA](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1617/ECAD+Arch/files/docs/RISCVGreenCardv8-20151013.pdf) or [ISA](https://dejazzer.com/coen2710/lectures/RISC-V-Reference-Data-Green-Card.pdf)

The milliForth is a program called by 'elsewhere alien operational system', and use registers r0, ra, sp, a0-a6. 

## Coding

*"qemu -kernel loads the kernel at 0x80000000 and causes each hart (i.e. core of CPU) to jump there."*

For assembler, use [standart Risc-V](https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-asm-manual) style with pre-processor directives eg. #define.

For now, using riscv-unknown-elf-gcc 15.0 suit with spike and qemu emulators for a single core minimal footprint Forth thread.  

I hope it uses far less than 4k bytes, without a user dictionary.

The milliForth must use memory pointers for data stack and return stack, because does fetch and store from a special 'user structure', which contains the user variables for Forth (state, toin, last, here, spt, dpt, tout, once, heap, tail).

This version includes: 

```
primitives:

    s@    return the address of user structure
    +     adds two values at top of data stack
    nand  logic not and the two values at top of data stack
    @     fetch a value of cell wich address at top of data stack
    !     store a value into a cell wich address at top of data stack
    0#    test if top of data stack is not zero

    :     starts compilng a new word
    ;     stops compiling a new word
    exit  ends a word

    key   get a char from default terminal (system dependent)
    emit  put a char into default terminal (system dependent)
        
only internals: 
    
    main, cold, warm, quit, djb2, 
    token, skip, scan, getline, 
    tick, find, compile, execute, comma, memcopy 

    unnest, next, nest, pick, jump, 

    ps. exit is unnest, next is not the NEXT of FOR loop    

with externals:

    _getc, _putc, _exit, _init, 

extensions: (selectable)

    2/      shift right one bit
    exec    jump to address at top of spt
    :$      jump to (ipt)   
    ;$      jump to next 

extras:    (selectable)

    bye     ends the Forth, return to system
    abort   restart the Forth
    .S      list cells in data stack
    .R      list cells in return stack
    .       show cell at top of data stack
    words   extended list the words in dictionary
    dump    list contents of dictionary in binary

A my_hello_world.FORTH alternate version with dictionary for use;

The sp@ and rp@ are now derived from s@ in the my_hello_world.FORTH

```

## Note

the originals files are edited for lines with less than 80 bytes

the bf.FORTH and hello_world.FORTH are from original milliForth[^1]

the my_hello_world.FORTH is adapted for miiliforth-6502
