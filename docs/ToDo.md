## Todo

    I need learn about how implement:

    ," " to push a string in dictionary and type it


    <builds create does> 
    variable constant 
    defer 
    postpone tick 

    = align done 

    = postpone is done, as extra configuration flag. (temporary)

    = create and variable, are in the minimal vocabulary.

    DPANS94: 
        PAD shall be at least 84 bytes.
        PIC (2*32)+2, at least 66 bytes.
